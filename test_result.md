# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

Need to implement buyer approve/reject endpoints and UI, then complete asset status lifecycle."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The page redirects to homepage instead of preserving the marketplace URL with campaign parameter. 2) ‚ùå CAMPAIGN PRE-POPULATION FAILURE: Due to URL parameter loss, the campaign selection dropdown in 'Request Best Offer' dialog shows default placeholder 'Select an existing campaign' instead of pre-populating with the intended campaign. 3) ‚ùå REDIRECT ISSUE: Could not test the redirect functionality due to authentication/session issues during testing, but based on code analysis, the handleOfferSubmit function in MarketplacePage.js does NOT include redirect logic to Buyer Dashboard ‚Üí Requested Offers tab after successful submission. ROOT CAUSES: A) React Router navigation issue causing URL parameter loss, B) Authentication/session management affecting page routing, C) Missing redirect logic in offer submission handler.

Lines 1186-1193 and 1212-1219 store campaign data in sessionStorage with full campaign object (id, name, end_date) AND navigate with URL parameter (?campaign=ID). 2) ‚úÖ IMPROVED CAMPAIGN PRE-POPULATION LOGIC: MarketplacePage handleRequestBestOffer function (lines 255-310) now checks BOTH URL parameters and sessionStorage with enhanced error handling and timeout logic. Function first tries URL parameter, then falls back to sessionStorage, with proper JSON parsing and error handling. 3) ‚úÖ ADDED REDIRECT AFTER REQUEST SUBMISSION: handleOfferSubmit function (lines 550-653) includes redirect logic to navigate('/buyer-dashboard?tab=requested-offers') after successful submission (line 647). BuyerDashboard properly reads 'tab' URL parameter and switches to Requested Offers tab (lines 61-65).

RESULTS: The reported bug is STILL PRESENT and the fixes are NOT working. ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING COMPONENTS: 1) Login functionality working correctly (marketing@grameenphone.com/buyer123), 2) Marketplace loading with 7 assets successfully, 3) List View toggle working, 4) View Details buttons found (7 available), 5) Request Best Offer dialog opens correctly, 6) Form shows 'Dhanmondi Lake Billboard' selected asset, 7) Console shows campaigns being fetched successfully. ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE CONFIRMED: After attempting to submit the 'Request Best Offer' form, the page redirects to the HOMEPAGE (/) instead of the expected '/buyer/dashboard?tab=requested-offers'. This confirms the exact bug described in the review request. ‚ùå ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: 1) The redirect logic in MarketplacePage.js handleOfferSubmit function (lines 647-653) appears to be implemented but is NOT executing properly, 2) No debug console logs were captured during submission, indicating the form submission may be failing silently, 3) No network requests to /api/offers/request were detected, suggesting the API call is not being made, 4) The route path fix from '/buyer-dashboard' to '/buyer/dashboard' is correct but irrelevant if the redirect code isn't executing. CONCLUSION: The redirect fix implementation exists in the code but is not functioning. The bug persists and requires immediate attention from the main agent to debug why the handleOfferSubmit function is not executing the redirect logic properly."

This prevents form completion and testing of submit functionality. 2) SESSION MANAGEMENT ISSUES: Frequent session loss during testing, causing redirects to homepage and interrupting test flow. 3) ENHANCED DEBUG FEATURES NOT TESTED: Unable to verify the new debug features (Submit Button Debug, Function Entry Debug, Form State Logging) due to inability to complete form submission caused by campaign dropdown issue. ‚ùå ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The campaign dropdown population logic is failing despite successful API calls. The issue appears to be in the frontend rendering of campaign options in the Select component, not in the data fetching. This prevents testing the enhanced debug features and redirect functionality. CONCLUSION: The enhanced debug version cannot be properly tested due to a fundamental campaign dropdown rendering issue that blocks form completion.

The dialog opens successfully, but the campaign fetching logic is not triggered. üéØ EXACT ISSUE: The Request Best Offer dialog is opening, but the fetchExistingCampaigns() function call inside handleRequestBestOffer is not executing, meaning no campaign data is ever requested from the API. This explains why the dropdown shows no options - there's no data to populate it with.

      message: "üö® ENHANCED DEBUG VERSION TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL CAMPAIGN DROPDOWN ISSUE IDENTIFIED! ‚ùå Conducted comprehensive testing of the ENHANCED DEBUG VERSION of the redirect fix for BeatSpace campaign pre-population flow as specifically requested in the review. RESULTS: Unable to complete testing due to critical campaign dropdown population failure. ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING COMPONENTS: 1) Authentication system working correctly (marketing@grameenphone.com/buyer123 login successful), 2) Marketplace loading with 7 assets, 3) List View toggle functional, 4) View Details buttons working (7 found), 5) Request Best Offer dialog opens successfully, 6) Form displays selected asset (Dhanmondi Lake Billboard), 7) Console shows 'Fetched campaigns: [Object, Object, Object]' indicating campaigns are loaded successfully. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: CAMPAIGN DROPDOWN POPULATION FAILURE - Despite campaigns being fetched successfully (console shows 3 campaign objects), the campaign selection dropdown shows 'Select an existing campaign' but when clicked, displays 0 campaign options. This prevents form completion and testing of submit functionality and enhanced debug features. ‚ùå ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The campaign dropdown population logic is failing despite successful API calls. The issue appears to be in the frontend rendering of campaign options in the Select component, not in the data fetching. This blocks testing of the enhanced debug features (Submit Button Debug, Function Entry Debug, Form State Logging) and redirect functionality. CONCLUSION: The enhanced debug version cannot be properly tested due to a fundamental campaign dropdown rendering issue that prevents form completion. The main agent needs to fix the campaign dropdown population before the redirect fix can be tested. This is a blocking issue that prevents verification of the enhanced debug features mentioned in the review request."
