BeatSpace is an outdoor branding marketplace connecting verified brands/marketing agencies (Buyers) with outdoor advertising agencies (Sellers) via an interactive map. It facilitates transparent transactions through a Request Best Offer workflow, earning commission. Buyers discover locations, build/manage campaigns, and track performance. Sellers showcase inventory and manage bookings. Admins control the system.

Core features include:
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Displays available assets with detailed info, search, and filtering (location, type, status, duration, size, pricing).
- **Asset Detail Pages**: Comprehensive information, visual content, availability, pricing, technical specs, and action buttons (Add to Campaign, Request Best Offer).
- **User Journeys**: Defined flows for Buyer (registration, exploration, campaign management, offer request, monitoring, billing, team management), Seller (registration, inventory management, verification, operations, performance tracking), and Admin (user/asset management, transaction mediation, platform operations).
- **Technical Requirements**: React.js/TypeScript frontend, FastAPI/Node.js backend, PostgreSQL (later inferred MongoDB), Redis, JWT authentication, RBAC, cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud, later Cloudinary), email/SMS notifications.
