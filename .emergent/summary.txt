The AI engineer systematically debugged and enhanced the BeatSpace application, focusing heavily on a critical WebSocket real-time synchronization issue. Initially, they addressed an infinite refresh loop caused by aggressive frontend event handlers, implementing debouncing, connection stability, and message throttling. Concurrently, UI/UX improvements were made to both Admin and Buyer Dashboards, including notification systems and refined data displays. A major bug involving demo data visibility for buyers was resolved by removing hardcoded frontend fallbacks. The work then transitioned to perfecting the bidirectional WebSocket communication, identifying and fixing multiple issues: incorrect backend URL usage, immediate connection closures due to authentication failures (invalid JWT structure), and finally, the critical discovery of uvicorn's  parameter breaking WebSocket functionality and the need to register WebSocket endpoints directly with the main FastAPI app, not just the API router. The trajectory concludes with this final, crucial fix being attempted.

<product_requirements>
The BeatSpace application is an outdoor advertising marketplace for Bangladesh, facilitating workflows for buyers, sellers, and administrators. It manages asset lifecycle (Available → Pending Offer → Booked → Live → Completed) and campaign lifecycle (Draft → Live → Complete). A core feature is the offer mediation process: Buyer requests → Admin quotes → Buyer approves → Asset booked. The application uses FastAPI, React, MongoDB, JWT authentication, and Cloudinary.

Previous work focused on:
1.  **Buyer Dashboard Fixes**: Correcting offer cancellation, using custom dialogs, filtering non-active offers, and accurate campaign asset counting.
2.  **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**: Improving Offer Mediation UI with detailed displays, pagination, and correct quote counts.
3.  **Real-time Synchronization**: Implementing a WebSocket-based system for instant updates between Admin and Buyer dashboards for offer quotes, approvals, rejections, revision requests, and new offer creations, aiming for zero manual refreshes.
4.  **UI Refinements**: Collapsible sections for buyers in Admin and enhanced asset details in Buyer Dashboard.
5.  **Recent Requests**: Fix campaign deletion to cascade to associated buyers and assets, and remove demo assets from buyer views.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into resolving a critical, persistent WebSocket connection issue. The user continuously reported that real-time updates and notifications were not working, despite numerous fixes to debouncing, connection stability, and authentication.

The investigation revealed several layers of problems:
1.  **Initial Infinite Loop**: Frontend refresh functions (, ) were rapidly triggered by WebSocket events. This was addressed by implementing 1.5-second debouncing using .
2.  **Incorrect WebSocket URL**: The frontend was attempting to connect to a production WSS URL in development, causing Insufficient resources errors. This was fixed by forcing localhost for development.
3.  **Immediate Connection Closure (Backend)**: Backend logs showed connections opening but immediately closing. This was first linked to an issue where  was being called twice (once in  and once in the endpoint itself). This duplicate call was removed.
4.  **Backend Authentication Errors**: The WebSocket endpoint was crashing with . This was fixed by correctly using  from .
5.  **Frontend Token Malformation**: Even after the backend fix, the frontend was sending a malformed JWT token (length 4, Not enough segments). Debugging showed the token was eventually valid, suggesting stale logs or a transient issue.
6.  **Backend  Workers Issue**: A critical discovery was that  running with  in the supervisor configuration was fundamentally breaking WebSocket connections, as WebSockets require a single process for state management. The engineer attempted to remove this parameter.
7.  **WebSocket Endpoint Registration (Current)**: The very latest diagnostic revealed that even after removing , the simple test WebSocket endpoint was returning a 404 (Not Found). This led to the conclusion that WebSocket endpoints must be registered directly with the main FastAPI  instance () and not just the .

The engineer's last explicit action was to move the WebSocket endpoint registration from  to  and remove the old router-level endpoints to avoid conflicts (Chat Message 621-623), aiming to finally establish a stable WebSocket connection.
