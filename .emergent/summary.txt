The AI engineer has systematically evolved the BeatSpace application from a buggy production-ready state to a feature-rich outdoor branding marketplace. The initial focus was on critical bug fixes, including restoring missing APIs and UI components. Subsequently, the engineer implemented and refined core features like the Request Best Offer workflow, campaign management for buyers, and asset management for administrators. This involved extensive modifications across frontend components (, , ) and backend API endpoints (). Key challenges included resolving complex React event handling issues, correcting API payload formats causing 422 errors, and implementing dynamic UI elements like dropdowns and conditional rendering. The process was iterative, driven by user feedback, with diligent debugging, testing, and UI/UX enhancements like consistent date formatting, dropdown action menus, and detailed price comparisons. The work is now focused on enhancing asset creation with dynamic dropdowns and image upload.

<product_requirements>
BeatSpace is an outdoor branding marketplace connecting brands (Buyers) with advertising agencies (Sellers) via an interactive map for commission-based transactions. Initial requirements included an interactive map with search/filter, detailed asset pages, defined user journeys (Buyer, Seller, Admin), a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack, JWT auth with RBAC, Cloudinary integration, and localization for Bangladesh.

Post-handover, the focus shifted to fixing critical bugs (backend APIs, frontend dashboards, map loading) and UI/UX improvements (homepage, logo). A Request Best Offer workflow was implemented, requiring campaign selection (new/existing), budget, service options, and asset availability checks. Asset lifecycle and campaign management rules (Live vs. Draft restrictions) were crucial. Marketplace filters were refactored. Recent refinements include consistent date handling in offer forms, improved campaign selection, robust edit/delete for requested offers in Buyer Dashboard, adding asset expiry dates, removing pricing from Campaign details, showing requested assets in Draft/Live campaigns, adding Add Asset button to marketplace, comprehensive campaign CRUD for buyers, and a refined UI with dropdown action menus. For Admin, full asset management (Add/Edit/Delete) with dynamic dropdowns for districts, divisions, and sellers, and image upload capabilities are being added.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Add New Asset and Edit Asset dialogs within the Admin Dashboard. The most recent focus was on improving data input and enabling media uploads.

Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Dynamic Dropdowns for Location and Sellers**: The user requested that the District and Division fields in the asset creation/editing form should be dropdowns populated with all districts and divisions of Bangladesh, respectively. Additionally, the Seller Name field needed to be a dropdown populated dynamically from users with the 'seller' role in the database.
    *   **AI Engineer's Action**: The engineer added state variables for , , and  in . Static data arrays for Bangladesh districts and divisions were added. A  function was implemented to retrieve users with the 'seller' role, and this function was integrated into . The Add Asset and Edit Asset dialogs were then modified to use Shadcn  components for these fields, displaying company name and email for sellers, and implementing validation.
2.  **Image Upload Functionality**: The user requested an option to upload images for assets, with the specific requirement that only the first uploaded image would be displayed in the asset list table. The functionality of the Create Asset button also needed verification.
    *   **AI Engineer's Action**: The engineer began implementing the image upload section. This involved adding the UI for image upload with a preview mechanism to both the Add Asset and Edit Asset dialogs within . The current state indicates that the UI for image upload has been added, and the next step is to integrate this with the asset table display and verify the Create Asset button.

The engineer has successfully added the image upload UI to the asset dialogs and is about to proceed with displaying images in the table and verifying the create functionality.

<optional_next_step>
Add a column to the Admin Dashboard's asset list table to display the first uploaded image for each asset, and then verify the Create Asset button's full functionality including image upload.
