The AI engineer's work involved an intensive period of bug fixing and feature enhancement for the BeatSpace application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more robust state. The core focus was on refining the Request Best Offer workflow and ensuring data consistency and UI accuracy across various user roles. A recurring challenge was debugging subtle data mismatches and frontend rendering issues, often requiring deep dives into both backend API responses and React state management. The engineer adopted an iterative approach, addressing specific bug reports from the user one by one. Key improvements included streamlining the buyer-admin negotiation flow, ensuring correct asset status displays in the marketplace, fixing campaign asset counts, and resolving complex issues related to the My Assets tab. The final major fix involved creating a dedicated backend API for fetching booked assets, which significantly improved the efficiency and reliability of the My Assets display. The trajectory showcases a systematic debugging methodology and a strong emphasis on user-driven, precise bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
BeatSpace is an outdoor branding marketplace connecting brands (Buyers) with advertising agencies (Sellers) using an interactive map, search/filter capabilities, and detailed asset pages. It supports role-based user journeys (Buyer, Seller, Admin) with JWT authentication. The application uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, integrating Cloudinary for media and localizing for Bangladesh.

Post-MVP development focused on a comprehensive Request Best Offer workflow. This involved implementing robust CRUD for offers and campaigns, handling asset expiry, and ensuring consistent date management. Pricing displays were removed from the marketplace to emphasize the offer-based negotiation. Admin functionalities were significantly enhanced for full asset, user, and campaign management, including image uploads and a sophisticated offer mediation system with price comparison and quoting. Key recent features include making campaign budgets optional, removing buyer's Estimated Budget, implementing custom contract durations, enhancing admin quote/approval flows with notifications, adding quick action buttons, ensuring the My Assets tab displays Booked assets, showing requested/approved assets in Buyer Campaign Details, and adding PDF download for campaign drafts. Further refinements included changing My Estimated Budget to Offered Price (conditional display), adding a Request Best Offer shortcut in the marketplace list view, and implementing a floating asset bucket list for buyers to request multiple assets in one go. The most recent efforts refined asset status display in the marketplace, corrected campaign asset counting, improved campaign details view to show all associated assets, and streamlined the fetching of booked assets for the My Assets tab.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a critical task related to the My Assets tab in the Buyer Dashboard. The user reported that the tab was not correctly displaying booked assets, often showing a persistent Loading booked assets... spinner or No Booked Assets Yet, despite known booked assets in the system.

The work concluded by implementing a more robust and efficient solution:
1.  **Backend API Creation**: A new dedicated endpoint, , was added to . This API now handles the complex logic of identifying and fetching only assets that are Booked for the currently authenticated buyer. It retrieves offers with Approved status for the buyer, then fetches the corresponding asset details, and finally filters to ensure only assets with  are returned. This centralizes the filtering on the server-side, making the data retrieval more efficient and reliable.
2.  **Frontend Refactoring**: The  function in  was refactored to exclusively call this new  endpoint. This simplifies the frontend logic significantly, removing previous complex client-side filtering and matching. The  hook triggering this function was also adjusted to depend on  to ensure  is only called once the user's authentication data is fully available, thus resolving the previous timing-related loading issues.

The issue is confirmed fixed, with the My Assets tab now correctly displaying booked assets in the requested list format, showing Asset Name, associated Campaign, Status (Booked), Duration (start to expiry date), and Asset Expiry Date. This resolves a long-standing display problem and streamlines the data flow for booked assets.
