The AI engineer systematically developed the BeatSpace application, transitioning it from a foundational state to a feature-rich outdoor branding marketplace. The initial phase focused on critical bug resolutions, including re-establishing missing APIs and refining UI components. Subsequently, the engineer implemented core functionalities such as the Request Best Offer workflow, comprehensive campaign management for buyers, and robust asset management for administrators. Key technical challenges involved rectifying React event handling, correcting API payload formats to prevent 422 errors, and creating dynamic UI elements. The development was iterative, driven by user feedback, with continuous debugging, testing, and UI/UX enhancements like consistent date formatting, dropdown menus, and detailed price comparisons. Recent efforts centered on enhancing asset creation with dynamic dropdowns and image uploads via Cloudinary, followed by extensive CRUD functionalities for user and campaign management, and bug fixes for pagination and display issues. The work is now focused on refining business logic, specifically pre-populating campaign selections.

<product_requirements>
BeatSpace is an outdoor branding marketplace connecting brands (Buyers) with advertising agencies (Sellers) through an interactive map for commission-based transactions. Initial requirements included an interactive map with search/filter, detailed asset pages, defined user journeys (Buyer, Seller, Admin), a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack, JWT authentication with RBAC, Cloudinary integration, and localization for Bangladesh.

Post-handover, the focus began with critical bug fixes and UI/UX improvements. A Request Best Offer workflow was implemented, involving campaign selection, budget, service options, and asset availability. Asset lifecycle and campaign management rules (Live vs. Draft restrictions) were crucial. Subsequent enhancements included consistent date handling, robust edit/delete for requested offers and campaigns, asset expiry dates, removal of specific pricing displays, displaying requested assets in campaigns, and a refined UI with dropdown action menus. For Admin, full asset management (Add/Edit/Delete) with dynamic location and seller dropdowns, and image upload capabilities were added. User Management CRUD was added with 'pending' to 'approved' status flow. Campaign Management CRUD was added with date calendars, multi-asset handling, and status workflow (Draft, Negotiation, Ready, Live, Completed). The Admin's Offer Mediation tab was revamped to show all pending offer requests with admin CRUD and price comparison. Recent business logic changes include removing pricing from Marketplace, hiding asset price from buyer-facing requested offers, renaming My Offer Price to My Estimated Budget, grouping requested offers by campaign, showing campaign budget vs. total asset estimated budget, and pre-populating campaign selection in the Request Best Offer dialog.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing several business logic changes requested by the user. The engineer successfully completed the following:

1.  **Removed pricing from the Marketplace**: All displays of asset pricing have been eliminated from , including asset cards, asset details dialogs, and pricing filters.
2.  **Removed Asset Price column from Buyer Dashboard**: The Asset Price column has been removed from the Requested Offers list in .
3.  **Renamed My Offer Price to My Estimated Budget**: The column header for My Offer Price in the Buyer Dashboard's Requested Offers has been updated to My Estimated Budget.

Following these immediate completions, the engineer started working on:

4.  **Grouping Requested Offers by Campaign**: The UI structure in  has been modified to group requested offers by their respective campaigns. This involves a significant change in how offers are displayed, moving from a flat list to a hierarchical view. While the initial structural replacement of the table for grouping has been performed (as indicated by the last successful edit), the complete implementation, particularly the show campaign budget vs Total Asset Estimated Budget, is part of this larger task.

The engineer is now actively beginning work on the very next and (per previous AI engineer's phrasing) final business logic fix:

5.  **Pre-populate campaign selection in Request Best Offer dialog**: The aim is to modify  so that when a user navigates to request an offer from a specific campaign context, the Campaign Selection dropdown in the Request Best Offer dialog is pre-filled with that campaign, streamlining the user experience.
