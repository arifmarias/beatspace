The trajectory details the iterative development of BeatSpace, an outdoor branding marketplace. Initially, the AI engineer inherited a supposedly production-ready application, which was found to have critical bugs, including missing APIs and UI rendering issues. The engineer systematically addressed these foundational problems, restoring core functionalities. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing key product features and improving the user experience, particularly around the Request Best Offer workflow and campaign management. This involved extensive frontend and backend modifications, including refining form logic, implementing granular asset controls based on campaign status, and addressing numerous user-reported bugs related to UI inconsistencies and data handling. The development process was characterized by continuous user feedback, leading to multiple rounds of bug fixes and feature refinements. The engineer diligently used screenshots and backend tests to verify each implemented change, ensuring functional correctness and visual accuracy.

<product_requirements>
BeatSpace is an outdoor branding marketplace connecting brands/agencies (Buyers) with outdoor advertising agencies (Sellers) via an interactive map for commission-based transactions. Initial requirements included an interactive map with search/filter, detailed asset pages, defined user journeys (Buyer, Seller, Admin), a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB tech stack, JWT auth with RBAC, Cloudinary integration, and localization for Bangladesh. The application needed to be production-ready with a futuristic homepage.

Post-handover, the focus shifted to critical bug fixes: backend API endpoints, frontend dashboard rendering (Admin, Buyer), and map loading. UI/UX improvements included homepage button text/styling and logo replacement. A comprehensive Request Best Offer workflow was implemented, involving campaign selection (new/existing), mandatory budget, detailed service options, and asset availability checks. Asset status lifecycle ( to /) and campaign management rules (Live vs. Draft campaign asset editing restrictions) were critical. Marketplace filters were refactored to a left sidebar. Recent refinements also included enhancing the Request Best Offer and Edit Offer forms with consistent date handling (start/expiration dates, auto-calculation, DD/MM/YYYY format), improved campaign selection (existing campaigns only), and robust edit/delete functionality for requested offers in the Buyer Dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a series of critical bug reports and refining the UI/UX for the Request Best Offer and Edit Offer Request functionalities, as reported by the user.

Specifically, the most recent work involved:
1.  **Date Formatting Consistency in Edit Offer Request Form**: The user reported that while the Asset Expiration Date was calculated correctly, it displayed in an inconsistent MM/D/YYYY format, unlike the Asset Starting Date's DD/MM/YYYY format.
2.  **AI Engineer's Action**: The engineer investigated this, identifying that  was causing the inconsistency. The fix involved implementing a custom date formatting logic ( etc.) to ensure both Asset Starting Date and Asset Expiration Date consistently display in  format within the .
3.  **Verification**: The engineer verified this fix by taking screenshots (Chat Message 396) which showed Asset Starting Date: 08/10/2025 and Asset Expiration Date: 08/01/2026, confirming the consistent  format.

The engineer successfully implemented and verified this final requested fix.
