The AI engineer's work, taking over from a previous AI, primarily focused on refining an asset management and offer mediation application. The initial task was to complete a crucial PO (Purchase Order) upload feature, which involved extensive frontend and backend updates, including Cloudinary integration. This core development was followed by a series of iterative bug fixes. Key challenges addressed included correcting status transitions, ensuring consistent data display across different dashboards (admin, buyer, marketplace), resolving date and timezone discrepancies across the stack, and rectifying asset visibility and campaign asset count issues. The process involved deep dives into code, debugging, and maintaining strict adherence to user requirements for functionality and UI. The trajectory showcases an agile, problem-solving approach to mature an MVP application.

The application is designed for managing and mediating asset requests and offers. The core problem involved improving the existing MVP features. Initial requirements focused on map visualizations. A significant feature request was a multi-stage Subscribe to Monitoring workflow, evolving into comprehensive asset categorization and offer mediation for admins. Assets were categorized into Public, Existing, and Private, each with unique visibility and data fields.

The current work explicitly required completing a **PO (Purchase Order) upload functionality** allowing both buyers and admins to upload PDF POs, store them in Cloudinary, and ensure visibility on both sides. The status flow should transition from PO Required to PO Uploaded, then to Live via an admin-only Make it Live button. Subsequent bug fixes clarified that Approve Asset should set status to PO Required (not Live), marketplace assets with PO Uploaded status should show Awaiting Go Live (orange badge) with an Asset Availability Notice and blocked calendar dates, campaign asset counts needed fixing, and all dates/timezones across the application must be consistent (Dhaka, Bangladesh).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central API server, defines models (, , ), and handles all data logic and interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **PO Upload**: Added , ,  to  and  models.
        *   ****: Implemented for Cloudinary PDF upload, updates offer status to PO Uploaded, sets , , . Initially updated asset status and  here, but later reverted asset status change.
        *   ****: Modified to handle PO Required status without automatically making assets/campaigns live. Added explicit logic to prevent auto-live when buyer approves an offer, ensuring Make it Live is the sole trigger.
        *   ****: Fixed  object attribute error by correctly using  dependency. Ensured it sets offer, asset, and campaign to Live and handles dates.
        *   ** and  endpoints**: Enhanced to include  flag and  (later ) based on PO Uploaded offer status. Adjusted to return raw dictionaries for flexible data. Fixed MongoDB  serialization.
        *   ** and **: Enhanced to include associated asset information for campaign asset counts. Removed strict response model validation.
        *   ****: Updated to correctly fetch campaign names and asset costs for various asset types (Public, Private, Existing). Added Live status to offer query.
        *   ** (buyer)**: Added filter to exclude Live status offers from Requested Offers tab.
        *   **Date & Timezone**: Integrated  for Dhaka timezone (). Modified all  to . Simplified date parsing from frontend. Removed complex timezone parsing for incoming dates, storing them as received (ISO strings) and relying on frontend to display correctly.
        *   **Database interaction**: Temporary scripts (, , , , ) were created and used for debugging database states and populating sample data.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manager-specific views, map, route assignment.
    -   **Changes**: (No direct changes in trajectory, but mentioned in initial architecture as improved map marker hover and re-rendering fixes)

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Buyer interface for marketplace interaction, request/offer management.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **PO Upload**: Added  function to manage PO uploads for buyers.
        *   **Bug Fixes**: Declared missing  and  state variables.
        *   **Campaigns Tab**: Integrated  for asset counts in campaign details.
        *   **Approve Offer**: Modified to correctly set offer status to PO Required without making asset/campaign live.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Administrator's control panel for asset/offer mediation.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **PO Upload**: Added PO upload dialog, Upload PO button, View PO button. Implemented file validation.
        *   **Status Display**: Fixed  to correctly show PO Uploaded. Ensured Make it Live button visibility logic. Corrected View PO button visibility for admin-uploaded POs.
        *   **Approve Asset**: Modified  to change status to PO Required instead of making asset live.
        *   **Offer Mediation Filtering**: Updated  to ensure PO Required and PO Uploaded offers remain visible.
        *   **Campaigns Tab**: Integrated  for asset counts in campaign details.
        *   **Dates Display**: Fixed display of start/end dates from N/A by adding fallback logic to check /.

<pending_tasks>
- Optimize loading time for Campaign Assets in the buyer campaign details dialog.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work being addressed is a performance issue in the Buyer Dashboard. Specifically, when a user clicks on a row element in the Campaigns tab to open the campaign details dialog, there is a noticeable lag (takes a bit of time) to load the Campaign Assets within that dialog. The user explicitly asked to investigate and fix this lagging issue, stating that it was working fine before and the lag appeared after recent changes. The previous actions led to fixing the display of campaign asset counts, but this introduced a performance regression. The current focus is to identify the root cause of this lag and optimize the data loading process for campaign assets when the dialog opens. The engineer's last action was to start investigating how campaign assets are currently loaded in the buyer dashboard to determine the best optimization strategy.
