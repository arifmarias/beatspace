The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned from understanding the initial codebase to implementing several complex features and critical bug fixes. The work began with a UI enhancement for map marker hover boxes, followed by significant refactoring of the monitoring service subscription workflow to integrate with an existing offer mediation system. Subsequently, the engineer addressed multiple bug reports related to map display after tab switching, asset assignment updates, and data loading issues in the Admin Dashboard. The final major feature involved implementing robust asset categorization (Public, Existing, Private) with conditional fields, marketplace visibility controls, and a buyer dropdown. The trajectory also includes a detailed guide and execution of a MongoDB migration to Atlas. The work is structured, with clear backend and frontend modifications, and includes self-verification steps.

The initial goal was to enhance the Map Marker hover box in the Route Assignment Tab to show all asset information clearly.
Subsequently, the user requested a full redesign of the hover box to be more compact, wider, and shorter, displaying all information without scrolling.
A bug was reported where operator assignment changes weren't updating in the hover box, requiring real-time state reading.
Another critical bug involved the map not reappearing when switching back to the Route Assignment tab, and then a follow-up fix for markers not showing after the map reappeared.
The major feature request involved a comprehensive MONITORING SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION WORKFLOW change: shifting from immediate activation to a Buyer Request -> Admin Offer Mediation -> Price Quote -> PO Upload -> Admin Activation -> Service Active flow. This included frontend (Buyer and Admin Dashboards) and backend modifications.
Following this, the BUYER DASHBOARD - REQUESTED OFFERS CATEGORIZATION was requested to categorize offers into Asset Bundle, Monitoring Service, and Additional Services with a tabbed interface and filtering.
Admin Dashboard errors (Failed to load live assets and Failed to offer requests) were reported and fixed, tracing to Pydantic validation and incorrect API endpoint usage.
A request to migrate local MongoDB to MongoDB Atlas was completed step-by-step.
Finally, Asset Categories were introduced for adding new assets: Public (marketplace visible), Existing Asset (conditional marketplace visibility with expiry date and buyer name), and Private Asset (not in marketplace, with one-off investment and buyer name). This included conditional field rendering, updated validation, and marketplace filtering. Subsequent bug fixes addressed private/existing assets showing in the marketplace incorrectly, buyer dropdown display inconsistencies, and asset creation Network Error due to missing/invalid fields. The last request was to show the next available date for existing assets like public assets, leading to a calendar date disabling feature.

- ****: This is the core backend file.
  - **Summary**: Defines FastAPI routes for assets, monitoring, offers, users, and handles data interaction with MongoDB. It was extensively modified for:
    - Creating offer requests instead of direct monitoring subscriptions.
    - Adding an endpoint for activating monitoring services.
    - Implementing asset categories (, , ) with new fields (, , , ).
    - Updating asset creation/update logic to handle category-specific validation.
    - Filtering marketplace assets based on category and  toggle, including legacy asset handling.
    - Adding a  endpoint to fetch users for dropdowns.
    - Fixing Pydantic validation issues for legacy data and incorrect API endpoint calls.
  - **Changes**: Major updates to , , , , , and the  Pydantic model.

- ****: Manages the manager's dashboard, including the route assignment tab and map functionality.
  - **Summary**: Initially modified to enhance the map marker hover box to display more comprehensive asset information (using , ). Later, fixes were applied to ensure map and markers re-render correctly upon tab switching, particularly addressing issues with  and stale marker references.
  - **Changes**: Modifications around map initialization ( function,  dependencies) and the content rendered within the .

- ****: Handles the buyer's portal, including asset browsing and offer requests.
  - **Summary**: Significantly updated to implement the new monitoring service subscription workflow. This involved changing the Subscribe to Monitoring button to create an offer request instead of an immediate subscription. Also, the Requested Offers tab was refactored into  for categorized display (Asset Requests, Monitoring Services, Additional Services).
  - **Changes**: Updates to , , and the integration of  to manage various offer types.

- ****: Manages the administrator's portal, including asset management and offer mediation.
  - **Summary**: Extensively modified for:
    - Displaying monitoring service requests within the Offer Mediation tab.
    - Adding Quote Service and Activate Service buttons for monitoring requests.
    - Implementing the new asset categories functionality in the Add New Asset and Edit Asset dialogs, including conditional field rendering (expiry date, one-off investment, buyer name dropdown) and marketplace toggle for Existing Assets.
    - Fixing API loading errors (Failed to load live assets, Failed to offer requests) by correcting API endpoints.
    - Refining asset creation/update form logic (, , , ) to correctly handle category-specific fields, validation, and status assignments.
    - Adding a Category column to the asset management table with color-coded badges.
    - Displaying Next Available Date (asset expiry date) for existing assets in the asset management table and detail view, like public assets.
    - Fixing the buyer dropdown not storing/showing selected values.
  - **Changes**: Numerous additions and modifications within asset creation/edit forms, data fetching functions, and table rendering logic.

- ****: Component specifically for the offer mediation UI within the Admin Dashboard.
  - **Summary**: Enhanced to display monitoring service requests alongside regular asset requests, providing visual distinction and new action buttons (, ). A new  was introduced for detailed quote and activation processes.
  - **Changes**: Updates to the request rendering logic, addition of conditional buttons, and inclusion of .

- ** (New File)**: A new component to handle the categorization and display of different offer request types.
  - **Summary**: Provides a tabbed interface for All Requests, Asset Requests, Monitoring Services, and Additional Services with dynamic counts and specialized card layouts for each request type.
  - **Changes**: New file created.

- ****: The public-facing marketplace where buyers can browse assets.
  - **Summary**: Modified to correctly display the Next available date for existing assets using their  field, consistent with public assets.
  - **Changes**: Update to the asset detail view logic to pull  when  is .

- Adjusting the Request Best Offer dialog's Asset Starting Date calendar to disable dates before the asset's next available date (or expiry date + 1).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the Request Best Offer dialog for live assets. Specifically, the task is to modify the asset starting date calendar within this dialog. The current requirement is that the calendar should disable all dates *before* the asset's next available date (which is essentially the asset's expiry date). This means the earliest selectable date should be the asset's next available date plus one day. The engineer had just started this task, having identified the relevant component () and was in the process of locating the specific Request Best Offer dialog and its calendar implementation to apply this date restriction. The goal is to ensure that users cannot select a booking start date for a Live existing asset that is earlier than when the asset actually becomes available.
