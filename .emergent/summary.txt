The AI engineer primarily focused on debugging and stabilizing the BeatSpace application's WebSocket real-time synchronization. This involved a multi-stage process addressing frontend debouncing, backend  configuration (, ), correct WebSocket endpoint registration on the FastAPI  instance (not ), and critical frontend URL detection issues. The engineer meticulously fixed a hardcoded  causing the frontend to connect to a test WebSocket endpoint instead of the main authenticated one, and eliminated  WebSocket interference by setting . After achieving stable WebSocket functionality, the UI was cleaned by removing Live - X active indicators. The work then transitioned to implementing a comprehensive BeatSpace Monitoring Service Feature, starting with defining new user roles (Manager, Monitoring Operator) and integrating their data models and authentication. The core API endpoints for the monitoring service were also added. The trajectory ends mid-way through integrating monitoring service subscription options into the Buyer Dashboard.

The BeatSpace application is an outdoor advertising marketplace for Bangladesh, managing asset and campaign lifecycles. Core features include offer mediation (Buyer requests → Admin quotes → Buyer approves). The application uses FastAPI, React, MongoDB, JWT auth, and Cloudinary.

Previous work aimed at:
1.  **Buyer/Admin Dashboard Fixes & Enhancements**: Correcting offer cancellation, improving Offer Mediation UI, filtering non-active offers, accurate campaign asset counting, removing demo assets.
2.  **Real-time Synchronization**: Implementing WebSockets for instant updates on offer quotes, approvals, rejections, revisions, and new offer requests, aiming for zero manual refreshes.

The new major feature being implemented is the **BeatSpace Monitoring Service**. This service aims to provide real-time asset condition monitoring with photo documentation and status reports. It introduces two new user roles:
*   **Manager**: Assigns monitoring tasks, monitors team performance, generates reports, manages schedules.
*   **Monitoring Operator**: Executes field tasks via a mobile interface, captures photos, updates status, and submits reports.

Existing roles (Admin, Buyer) are enhanced to oversee and subscribe to monitoring services, respectively. The service workflow involves customer selection of frequency/duration, service activation upon campaign Live status, real-time updates via WebSockets, and various reporting features. UI/UX should be intuitive, align with current design, and minimize clicks, with a strong mobile-first focus for operators.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the BeatSpace Monitoring Service Feature. The focus was on **Phase 1: Foundation & User Management**, and transitioning into **Phase 4: User Interfaces**.

**Key work done:**
1.  **Backend Model & API Expansion**:
    *   New user roles (, ) added to  enum.
    *   New Pydantic models for , , , and  were defined in .
    *   Authentication helper functions (, ) were added.
    *   A comprehensive set of new API endpoints for managing monitoring plans, tasks, reports, and photos were added to .
2.  **Frontend Dashboard Creation & Routing**:
    *   Skeletal  and  components were created.
    *    was updated to include routing for these new dashboards.
3.  **Buyer Dashboard Integration (Partial)**:
    *   The engineer was in the process of enhancing the  to allow buyers to subscribe to monitoring services. State variables related to monitoring were added, and the engineer was about to add the actual subscription interface within the campaign actions menu (specifically after the Campaign Planning PDF option).

The WebSocket real-time synchronization system, which was the preceding major task, has been **fully resolved** and is functioning correctly, including the notification bells in both Admin and Buyer dashboards, after resolving multiple complex issues related to uvicorn, frontend URL detection, and webpack dev server interference. The UI was also cleaned by removing the explicit Live - X active status indicators, leaving the subtle green dot on the bell.
